I’m passionate about Cybersecurity, but there’s more to me than just my academic pursuits! When I'm not in class, you can usually find me engaging in one of my many hobbies. I believe that exploring different interests helps me stay balanced and creative, and it's these passions that keep me excited about life outside the classroom.

Whether it's sports, technology, arts, or just exploring new places, I love learning and experiencing new things. On this page, I'll share a bit about what I do when I'm not hitting the books!
