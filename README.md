# My Hobbies



I’m passionate about Cybersecurity, but there’s more to me than just my academic pursuits! When I'm not in class, you can usually find me engaging in one of my many hobbies. I believe that exploring different interests helps me stay balanced and creative, and it's these passions that keep me excited about life outside the classroom.

Whether it's sports, technology, arts, or just exploring new places, I love learning and experiencing new things. On this page, I'll share a bit about what I do when I'm not hitting the books!


<h3>Gaming</h3>

<p align-"center">
Gaming is a big part of my life — it's not just a hobby, it’s a way to unwind and connect with friends. From strategy games like "Warhammer", to story-driven RPGs like "The Witcher3 : The Wild Hunt", I love immersing myself in virtual worlds. I'm also interested in the development side of gaming and hope to explore game design or development in the future.

<h2>Fitness & Sports</h2>

Staying active is important to me. Whether it’s going for a run, hitting the gym, or playing basketball with friends, I enjoy a variety of physical activities. I believe that being physically fit helps me maintain focus and reduces stress, especially during exam periods.

<h2>Cooking</h2>

I’ve recently gotten into cooking and exploring new recipes. It started as a necessity but quickly turned into a passion. I love experimenting with different cuisines and finding new ways to make healthy meals that taste great. You might even find some of my favorite recipes on my personal food blog: [Food Blog Link, if applicable].
